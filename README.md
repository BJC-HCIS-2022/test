# Testing, and random stuff for the class
This repository is for testing stuff and to put stuff that we can use in our work. An "md" file is something called MarkDown.
You are currently reading README.md

## History lesson
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and "markdown" is a play on that, being a "language" that formats text, but in a simpler way than HTML.
[Markdown reference](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) -- If you happen to use reddit, then you might already know some "markdown."

Here's Ada Lovelace (yes, daughter of that Byron):

![Ada Lovelace](https://github.com/BJC-HCIS-2022/test/blob/main/ava-lovelace.png)

From Wikipedia:
>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.
